Product Preview Challenge from Frontend Mentors

In this product preview challenge I tried using flexbox to acheive the overall structure. 

I usted media queries to make a responsive layout.

Everything was developed as mobile first, and the style.css file has the sections commmented for structure css, style css, and media queries.
